This is a book about creating compilers using NQP.

It is intended to be something of a tutorial -- walking the reader
through the stages of building a simple compiler and incrementally
adding features to get a full-fledged language.

Currently the primary author is Patrick Michaud, but anyone who
is willing to work on the book is welcome to join the effort.
We tend to hang out on #parrot on irc.parrot.org and #perl6 on
irc.freenode.net .

To build the book, you need to have the following software installed:

    * make
    * perl 5
    * the Perl 5 module Pod::PseudoPod::LaTeX
    * inkscape (for svg -> pdf conversion)
    * pdflatex

Just type 'make' on your command line, and the book should be built in
build/nqpbook.pdf .

(Hint for Kubuntu 9.10:  In order to get the above modules, I did
    cpan Pod::PseudoPod::LaTeX
    apt-get install inkscape texlive-latex-base
)
